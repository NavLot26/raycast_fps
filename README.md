# Raycasted Shooter Game
This is a basic raycasted shooter game I wrote in 8th grade using python and pygame. It uses a raycasting algorithm to display maze like levels with monsters that chase and attack you. There is a basic level system with different maps and guns that change as you progress through levels.

## Tech Stack
- Python 
- Pygame

(No external libraries for the semi-3D rendering, I used a custom algorithm that avoids trigonometry since I did not know very much at the time of creation)



## Old versions
I did not use git when creating this project, but old versions of the code are stored in the archive folder, and they can be run just like the main code. 


## Run
- python3 main.py

(make sure you have pygame installed)
